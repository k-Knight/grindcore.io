      <h2>Grindcore as a music genre</h2>
      <p>This website is dedicated to the exploaration of music genre called Grindcore. Grindcore is very
        extreme genre of music. Taste for grindcore music is usually an acquired taste, meaning it does
        not come naturally for most of the people.
        According to Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore">article</a> on this genre:
        <q><strong>Grindcore</strong> is an extreme fusion genre of heavy metal and hardcore punk
          that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding
          musical styles, such as: <strong>thrashcore</strong>, <strong>crust punk</strong>, <strong>hardcore punk</strong>,
          <strong>extreme metal</strong>, and <strong>industrial</strong>. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound
          that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass,
          high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks.

        Grindcore is a very niche genre with relatively small amounts of listeners as it is very extreme.
        However, it does not mean that the genre is monotonous or dull. Grindcore being a subgenre of metal
        and punk has several microgenres.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Deathgrind and Goregrind</h3>
        <p>
          Death grind is a mixture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal">death metal</a> genre
          and grindcore. It usually has more down-tuned guitars than regular a grindcore. It more relies
          on growls and low-pitched scream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goregrind most of the times can be characterized as deathgrind by its sound. The difference is that
          this microgenre relies on lyrics that depict gore and forensic pathology. The most credited band
          for microgenre emergence is British band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">
          Carcass</a>, specifically, their early albums.
        </p>

        <h3>Coprogrind and Pornogrind</h3>
        <p>
          These microgenres in their sound do not differentiate from grindcore. Their major difference is their
          lyrical themes. Coprogrind relies on excrements and defecation, while pornogrind usually depicts
          pornography and perversion.
        </p>

      <section></section>
        <h3>Noisegrind</h3>
        <p>
          The most prominent difference is Noisegrind's sound quality. It is usually heavily distorted
          and additional noise added to it, sometimes excessively. Most bands record their music at a very low quality.
          The music value of addition of noise to the music is very questionable as noise has no melody, temp or
          structure. The use of noise can be explained by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">
          DIY</a> mentality of the musicians and their preference
          for, as they call it, "raw" and unprocessed sound.
